# How-does-Public-Attitude-towards-Dogecoin-Change-Between-Surges-and-Plunges-Periods-
This project aims to unfold  textual differences in public discussion about Dogecoin on social media platform in China between typical surges and plunges in 2021. We choose Weibo as our data source because it is the most popular public social media platform in China. According to the price movements of Dogecoin in 2021, we select two periods (2021.4.13-4.17, 4.28-5.8) to collect our textual samples in surges and two periods (2021.5.9-5.13, 6.3-6.22) for plunges. Based on the conventional content analysis such as word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis is conducted to reveal the potential differences in public emotion and attitude alongside the surges and plunges. Concerning findings, discussions about dogecoin are mainly about the financial value that it has currently. Also, they are closely related to hot news events, especially related to tweets posted by Elon Musk. Besides, in surges, discussions are mainly about the price trend. People are willing to talk about investment behavior decisions. However, in plunges, people may easily be in negative emotions. Therefore, people may be intended to find something to rely on emotionally and psychologically.
